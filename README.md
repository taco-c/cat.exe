# Cat Simulator 2019

The entire cat owning experience packed into one small executable! Minus the ever-precence fear of your life.

## How to run

Just run `make` on the Makefile if you know what you're doing, if not, there are executables in "releases".

Then run `cat.exe` with an optional argument for the cat's name, if you are so inclined. (It will be called cat.exe even on linux, because why not).

```
./cat.exe [catname]
```

## How to pet the cat?

No petting allowed or wanted.

## Licencing

Licenced under the GNU GLP v3 licence, so that Microsoft won't to use it to spy on you.

You're welcome.
